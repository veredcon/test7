"""
Instrumented wrappers for extension calls.

Provides wrapper functions that add OpenTelemetry span attributes when calling
extension tools. Uses the ``extension_context`` context manager from the SAP
Cloud SDK for Python to set OTel **baggage** (propagated to downstream services
via HTTP headers) and explicitly stamps **span attributes** on the agent's own
spans so extension metadata is visible in agent-side traces (Jaeger, Dynatrace,
Grafana, etc.).

When a ``source_mapping`` dict is provided (from
``ext_impl.source.tools``), all seven ``sap.extension.*`` span attributes
are resolved from the source info for *the specific tool* being called,
enabling per-tool telemetry attribution when multiple extensions are merged.

Also provides ``emit_extensions_summary_span`` to emit a sibling
``agent_extensions_summary`` span with aggregate counts and timing for all
extension operations performed during one agent execution.

Usage:
    from extension_telemetry import call_extension_tool

    result = await call_extension_tool(
        mcp_client=session,
        tool_info=tool_info,
        args={"param": "value"},
        extension_name="ServiceNow Extension",
        source_mapping=ext_impl.source.tools if ext_impl.source else None,
    )

    # After all extension operations complete:
    from extension_telemetry import emit_extensions_summary_span

    emit_extensions_summary_span(
        tool_call_count=3,
        hook_call_count=2,
        has_instruction=True,
        total_duration_ms=1847.3,

            Typically from iterating an ``McpServer``'s tools.
